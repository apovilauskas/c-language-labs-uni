# C Language Labs

This repository contains my university exercises written in C.  
Each task is designed to build understanding of core programming concepts such as functions, pointers, arrays, and file handling.

## Topics
- Loops and conditions
- Arrays and strings
- Functions and pointers
- Basic file I/O

## Notes
Each file is an independent task completed as part of university coursework.
